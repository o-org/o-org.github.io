<p>We have been working on special education apps for more than 3 years. Our story has started with our co-founder’s brother, Alper, who is in the spectrum. His success with Otsimo has led us to create more educational games for more than 100,000 special kids.</p>
<p>We have been working hard for the next update of Otsimo | Special Education. We have developed a new curriculum system for Otsimo, which includes a developmental test, learning paths, and brand new games. All improvements are the result of more than 3 years of 10+ people team effort. As you may know; good-quality, full-featured software like Otsimo is very expensive to develop and maintain.</p>
<p>With sharper eyes on our data, we’ve noticed that most of our long-term users were not upgrading to Otsimo Premium. This didn’t seem fair to anyone involved, particularly since our revenue still falls short of where it needs to be for Otsimo to be both maintained and improved in the years to come.</p>
<p>It doesn’t help that many of the world’s favorite apps are free, so we’ve all grown used to pretty decent software that costs us nothing. What is easy to overlook, though, is that most good-quality free apps either advertise to us or sell our data to someone in the background. We believe neither in advertising to special kids nor in selling your personal data. As a result, the free version of Otsimo | Special Education makes only an indirect contribution to supporting our efforts by increasing our overall user base in the hope that a sufficient percentage of users will become customers.</p>
<p>With all this in mind, we’ve decided to make the following changes to our pricing and plans, which will be effective after October 25th, 2019.</p>
<h3 id="existing-customers-with-subscriptions">EXISTING CUSTOMERS WITH SUBSCRIPTIONS</h3>
<p>Customers with existing paid subscriptions will retain full functionality and will be able to renew their subscription at the pre-October 25th monthly or yearly prices indefinitely.</p>
<p>Users with current subscriptions obtained via contests, promotional coupons or other non-standard means will be handled on a case-by-case basis. Any verifiable “lifetime” subscriptions or discounts will be honored.</p>
<h3 id="new-users-who-join-on-or-after-october-25th-2019">NEW USERS WHO JOIN ON OR AFTER OCTOBER 25th, 2019</h3>
<p>Our full-featured, unlimited version will be available on a 7-days trial basis to all new user accounts created on or after October 25th;</p>
<p>Our free limited-functionality version will no longer be available on or after October 25th, 2019.</p>
<h3 id="existing-users-without-subscriptions">EXISTING USERS WITHOUT SUBSCRIPTIONS</h3>
<p>Existing users without a subscription can use our freemium plan until October 25th, after which they will need to subscribe to one of the subscriptions in order to continue using Otsimo | Special Education.</p>
<p>Customers without existing subscriptions can purchase the discounted annual premium subscription for existing users and benefit from the current lower annual price indefinitely. (If you appreciate what Otsimo does for you, we highly recommend this!)</p>
<p>On October 25th, all existing users without subscriptions will be asked to purchase a subscription in order to continue using Otsimo | Special Education.</p>
<p>After October 25th, accounts without subscriptions will be disabled but will retain their associated data. Users may decide to purchase a subscription at a later date.</p>
<p>Overall, we hope these changes will result in a fairer distribution of the cost of Otsimo. Our warm thanks go to all of the great people who have supported us as customers and contributors; we promise to do our best to create better educational games for kids with special needs.</p>
<p>As always, we welcome your thoughts and questions!</p>
<p>Hasan Zafer Elcik - CEO of Otsimo</p>
